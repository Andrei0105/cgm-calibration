First example of possible errors in the algorithm used for calibrations in Spike

Sensor/CGM: Libre 1 + Miaomiao 2

Spike calibration settings: 
- Skip Warm-Ups: Disabled
- Non-Fixed Calibration Slopes: Enabled

The calibration points are:
- 'created_at': '2020-06-12T11:59:36.000Z', 'glucose': 178, 'unfiltered_avg': 183117
- 'created_at': '2020-06-12T15:42:19.000Z', 'glucose': 130, 'unfiltered_avg': 141882
- 'created_at': '2020-06-14T15:06:06.000Z', 'glucose': 178, 'unfiltered_avg': 213353

The first graph represents the slopes generated from all 3 calibration points. The red slope (second one in the legend) is the one used by Spike, while the blue slope is the best fit line for the 3 points.

It can be seen that the difference between the 2 slopes is very large, and there is no explanation for the one generated by Spike considering the 3 calibration points.

This graph shows the slopes for the first 2 calibration points. The slopes are nearly the same, which confirms that Spike was working properly, and that these are actually the first 2 calibrations points.

The slight difference is because Spike does not record the raw value at the time of the calibration to Nightscout, so the raw value for a calibration point is considered the average between the raw values of the previous and the next data points.

This image shows the slope generated from the last 2 calibration points (first on in the legend) in dark blue, and the slope from Spike in light blue. They do not match, which means that Spike was not using only the last 2 calibration points to generated the slope.

It is unclear how Spike generated the slope it was using (slope=1818, intercept=-111433), given the 3 data points.

With 4 calibration points the slope generated by Spike is still wrong.

With 5 calibration points, the steepness of the slope is correct, but the intercept (offset) is wrong.
