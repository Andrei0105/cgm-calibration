Before starting the sensor, all Spike data was deleted from the phone, and Spike was uninstalled. After installation, the Miaomiao was paired again.

Sensor/CGM: Libre 1 + Miaomiao 2

Spike calibration settings: 
- Skip Warm-Ups: Disabled
- Non-Fixed Calibration Slopes: Enabled

The calibration points are:
- 'created_at': '2020-06-15T19:43:10.000Z', 'glucose': 137, 'unfiltered_avg': 147941
- 'created_at': '2020-06-16T05:08:58.000Z', 'glucose': 121, 'unfiltered_avg': 168352
- 'created_at': '2020-06-16T14:22:45.000Z', 'glucose': 97, 'unfiltered_avg': 122000
- 'created_at': '2020-06-17T08:02:01.000Z', 'glucose': 68, 'unfiltered_avg': 105588


For the first calibration, done with a BG value of 137, Spike chooses a calibration slope with a slope parameter of 911. Most of my sensors had slopes of under 1000 so this seems a good choice.

The second calibration reveals a problem. Even though the BG is 121 according to my meter, the raw value reported by Libre is lower than it was for the previous calibration. Naturally, the 2 points are connected by a line with a negative slope which does not make sense, since it would mean that for increasing raw values reported by the Libre, the BG actually decreases.

Situations like this generally occur in the first days of a new Libre sensor, while the sensor is still adjusting itself. It seems that Spike acted as it was calibrating for the first time. It kept a similar slope (926) to the previous calibration, but changed the offset to match the new value.

For the third calibration Spike did the same thing again. It ignored the previous calibration values, kept a similar slope, and changed the offset.

The fourth calibration is different. For the first time, the slope was considerably changed. The value is now above 1000 at 1126. However the slope does not match the one generated from all 4 calibration points. However the line is passing through the second and the fourth calibration point.

Here we can see the calibration slope generated by Spike from the fourth calibration, against the line that connects the second and fourth calibration points. They are similar, both in the steepness of the slope and offset, and the small difference is probably caused by the approximation used to calculate the raw values at calibration (Spike does not report raw values for calibrations, so the raw value is the average between the previous and the next raw value).
